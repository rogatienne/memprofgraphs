# Memory Profiling graphs dataset

In this repository you can find the five directed graph used as a testbed for graph algorithms in some research paper (see other repositories).

The smallest one, Oracle-16k, can be downloaded from GitHub.

The others will be available soon using links (they are too big for GitHub).
